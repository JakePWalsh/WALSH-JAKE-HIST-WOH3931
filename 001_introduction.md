# Introduction

     Japan’s entrance into the Second World War bred violence, decisive battles, and a crushing, though arguably inevitable, defeat. The forefront variables for their entrance were their own particular imperialistic ambitions and imperative to develop economic productivity and national security. These variables are predicated upon Japan’s rapid industrialization and modernization throughout the 19th century, which elicited a national imperative to expand territory in order to meet economic needs and fulfill nationalistic ambition. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Japan underwent significant economic turmoil because of the Great Depression, the Great Kanto earthquake, and the financial crises. Because of this, alongside individual nationalist ambitions to expand territory, Japan’s entrance was seemingly ineluctable.

     In addition, there were three prominent battles that the Japanese engaged in, which bore a significant contribution to the overall Japanese war effort and the progression of their military initiatives. First, the Japanese conquest of the Philippines. Japan invaded the Philippines and occupied it for three years. This conquest demonstrated Japan’s early triumphs in the Pacific theater and effective military strategy. Secondly, the Battle of Okinawa was a decisive battle fought on the island of Okinawa that ended with an American triumph over the Japanese imperial army. The battle proved to be a significant defeat for Japan. They lost vast quantities of men, ships, and aircraft and also led to the United States being closer to the Japan mainland. Lastly, the Battle of Midway was also a decisive battle that ended with Japanese defeat against the US. It effectively ended the Japanese imperial expansion and elicited heavy losses for their navy and aircraft.

     The conquest of the Philippines brought about a period of significant Japanese imperialism and nationalistic ambition, but with the battle of Midway and Okinawa, these imperialism initiatives were stifled by a greater, resource-bound power: the United States. Specifically with the battles of Midway and Okinawa, these battles illustrated the disparity in resources, military strategic planning, and manpower between the Japanese and the United States. Although Japan indeed enjoyed early victories in the Philippines and Pearl Harbor, it ultimately fell short in matching the naval prowess necessary for the fulfillment of its own initiatives and thus suffered great losses throughout the war in the Pacific theater.
