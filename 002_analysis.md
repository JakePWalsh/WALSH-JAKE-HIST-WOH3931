# Analysis - Philippines (Brett Biddle)

The initial Japanese landings in the Philippines occurred on December 8, 1941. The Japanese set for the Philippines with two main goals in mind, they aimed to seize the island for the resources and eliminate General Douglas A. MacArthur’s Far Eastern Air Force[^1]. Both goals were vital to the success of the Japanese conquest of the rest of the Pacific Ocean. The Japanese saw the Philippines as a necessity to conquer as their fear was of American bombardment with their Armies Aircore1 and feared that without the Philippines they could not extract the massive rubber and oil reserves that were needed from the Netherlands East Indies and Malaya to fuel their war effort[^2]. The invasion began on Bataan Island, with forces deployed from Taiwan.

The major conflicts that happened in the Philippines were the Battle of Bataan and the Battle of Corregidor. The first of these battles was the Battle of Bataan which was fought from January 7 to April 9, 1942. After the Japanese launched their attack on the Philippines in December 1941, General Douglas MacArthur's forces, which was a combination of both American and Filipino troops, were backed into the Bataan Peninsula by the powerful attacks by the Japanese. The ongoing battle left the American and Filipinos with limited supplies with the Americans unable to get supply to the peninsula[^3]. The Japanese had a blockade on the whole region making resupply almost impossible.

On April 9, Major General Edward King surrendered the remaining forces in Bataan, leading to the infamous Bataan Death March. The captured soldiers were forced to march over 60 miles in extreme heat with little food or water, resulting in thousands of deaths due to starvation, dehydration, and mistreatment by Japanese guards. The fall of Bataan marked a significant moment in the advance of the Japanese forces showing their strength within the region. The other major battle was the Battle of Corregidor the Japanese saw, Corregidor Island as a critical objective in securing control over the Philippines and expanding their strategic hold in the Pacific. 

Corregidor Island was the last major Allied stronghold guarding Manila Bay, and its capture was essential for ensuring unrestricted access to the vast resources in the region. After securing Bataan in April 1942, Japanese forces, led by General Masaharu Homma, turned their full attention to Corregidor[^4]. Japanese commanders anticipated a difficult assault due to Corregidor's rugged terrain and entrenched American and Filipino defenders on the island. The Japanese started by bombarded the island with relentless air raids and artillery fire to weaken resistance and erode the defenders' morale5. This strategy was designed to inflict maximum damage before launching the ground assault. 

In early May 1942, Japanese troops began their amphibious landings, facing resistance from the defenders. After fierce fighting and the methodical destruction of Allied positions, the Japanese succeeded in advancing through the island’s defenses. On May 6, under overwhelming pressure and depleted resources, American General Wainwright surrendered, marking a hard-won Japanese victory[^5]. The capture of Corregidor completed the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, securing critical resources and bolstering their defensive perimeter across Southeast Asia.

# Analysis - Midway (Aidan Collins)

In the early engagements between the Japanese Imperial Navy (JIN)and the American Navy the Japanese enjoyed a string of victories that left their power unchecked in the Pacific Ocean. After the partly successful neutralization of the American base at Pearl Harbor the IJN planned to make territorial expansions to the south and southeast of Japan and gain valuable resources. Once they were satisfied this expansion ceased. The second phase of Japan’s plan was to establish a defensive perimeter around their new Empire by acquiring the outposts at Midway and the Aleutians. With these outposts established the Japanese would then move on to establish air superiority within a 1,300-mile radius of their new defensive perimeter, which would include the American territory of Hawaii.

Japan’s ambitious military strategy would begin to be tested in May of 1942 at the Battle of Coral Sea, the precursor to the Battle of Midway. This battle would end in a strategic victory for the Allies that would cause a hindrance in Japanese expansion and result in the destruction of one Japanese light carrier and damage to another carrier. The American Navy would sustain slightly heavier losses through the sinking of the USS Lexington, a heavy carrier and damage to the USS Yorktown, another heavy carrier.

{% include media.html pages=media %}

After the Battle of Coral Sea, the Japanese would return to various bases of operation for repair in preparation for the future operation at Midway. Going into this battle the Japanese Imperial Navy had 4 of their 6 major carriers available to them. The two carriers that were out of commission for the IJN were the Shokaku, the carrier that was damaged at Coral Sea, and the Zuikaku. The latter of these two ships was in functional condition but was restricted from service because many of the ship's pilots had been shot down at Coral Sea[^6].

Japan’s navy had a strict policy at the time of pairing pilots exclusively with a single carrier and did not allow for transfers of pilots from one ship to another. Without this policy, the Japanese would have had a 5 to 3 carrier advantage over the U.S.A at Midway[^7].

Though the Battle of Midway occurred from the 4-7 of June much of the battle took place on the first day of engagement. Of their six heavy carriers the Japanese Imperial Navy was able to utilize the Akagi, Soryu, Kaga, and Hiryu while the American Navy had the Yorktown, Hornet, and Enterprise at their disposal. First contact was made by a floating boat plane that took off from Midway. The plane sighted some of the Japanese fleet at 5:45 a.m. and soon spotted their enemy’s carriers. Midway immediately dispatched a group of torpedo planes and B-26's to meet their enemy. The attack force was unsuccessful in taking out any of the IJN’s carriers. () The Japanese Navy also sent a strike force to Midway and were successful in inhibiting the fueling operations on the outpost. Soon after, the Enterprise and Yorktown sent dive bombers after the Japanese carriers and struck hits on all carriers, save the Hiryu. 

{% assign media = site.media_metadata | where_exp: "item", "item.name == 'akagi'" %}
{% include media.html pages=media %}

The Akagi faced constant attack from American forces for a few hours before they were finally able to clear the skies of enemy crafts. Soon after the Akagi had dispelled this attack a second wave of American pilots descended upon the carrier and its sister ships. Despite its best efforts of maneuvering, the Akagi sustained multiple hits from dive bombers. These hits were not fatal in themselves, but they did cause a chain reaction of fires and explosions. These explosions were partly due to the Akagi preparing to send off another wave of attacks[^8]. 

The Kaga also encountered sustained attacks from American dive bombers and torpedo planes at the same time. While trying to outmaneuver these forces, the Kaga was struck by multiple bombs, resulting in abandoning the ship. The Soryu faced these same problems along with these other carriers. After sustaining three hits, fires broke out on the ship and the men on board were ordered to evacuate. The captain of the ship Ryusaku Yanagimoto stayed on board and went down with his ship. The Hiryu attempted to escape the mayhem of the Battle of Midway and the fate that her fellow carriers had met but was unable to do so. In the afternoon of the 4 of June American dive bombers struck the Hiryu and took down the last of the four Japanese heavy carriers that had assaulted Midway.  

The Yorktown was the only major loss that the American forces sustained during the Battle of Midway. During the battle, the ship was hit by Japanese torpedoes, Though the Yorktown lost maneuvering function it remained in the fight. After the fighting had died down an effort to salvage the ship was made. While being salvaged a Japanese submarine fired multiple torpedoes and damaged the carrier. The Yorktown would sink on June 7[^9].

The Japanese defeat at Midway marked a turning point in the war in the Pacific. The American fleet halted the expansion of the Japanese Empire and secured the vital outpost at Midway from being taken. With Midway being secured for the Allies, the Hawaiian Islands were saved from potential future assaults by Japanese forces. Along with this the Japanese sustained heavy losses that would shift the balance of power in the Pacific Theatre. The IJN had lost four of the six carriers available to them which evened the playing field between them and the American Navy. Japan was now at the mercy of America’s industrial capabilities which allowed them to create aircraft carriers at a higher rate than Japan. Coinciding with the loss of these valuable carriers was the loss of 250 aircraft and 100 first line pilots which had aided in Japan’s incredible conquests in the earlier years of the war[^10].

# Analysis - Okinawa (Juan Barahona Trigueros)

GRAND STRATEGY

The Japanese 32nd Army's defense of Okinawa was less about strategic gains and more a fight for survival. Recognizing Okinawa's strategic importance over a year before the U.S. landings on April 1, 1945, the Imperial Japanese Army faced challenges in resource allocation. Lessons from Guadalcanal revealed that the U.S. had superior firepower, making Japan's usual tactics—light armament, infiltration, and close combat—ineffective for Okinawa's defense. Consequently, the Japanese adapted their approach, understanding that traditional methods would not suffice against the overwhelming American force they would encounter in the Ryukyu Islands[^11].

With this shift in trends, the Imperial General HeadQuarters (IGHQ) expected Okinawa’s defense to be achieved by air power, and that the 32nd army’s main job would be to convert the island into a Giant air base. Beginning in April, 1944, the 32nd army was tasked with the construction of airfields that was ultimately delayed due to lack of resources. The 32nd only had two bull-dozers and one earth roller, so the troops had to resort to shovels, baskets, and other limited means. To further complicate things, from a broader strategy view, Japan had neither the appropriate amount of planes or pilots to conduct their surmised air defense[^12].

{% assign media = site.media_metadata | where_exp: "item", "item.name == 'okinawatractors'" %}
{% include media.html pages=media %}

The entire time, IGHQ had been under the impression that the U.S. would strike at Okinawa first to facilitate a later invasion of mainland Japan. With their loss in Saipan, IGHQ started transferring troops over to Okinawa to increase ground defense from July to August 1944. These transfers consisted of the elite 9th infantry division(ID), the 62nd ID, the 24th ID, and the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade (IMB). However, U.S. landings in Palau and Leyte in September showed that the U.S.’s next target was the Philippines and not Okinawa. The 9th ID was quickly sent to Leyte, leaving the 32nd army to fend for itself[^13].

Following the withdrawal of the 9th ID, the 32nd army immediately focused on the land defense of Okinawa, abandoning the air base idea, and preparing a combination of defensive line, and guerilla tactics. The 32nd created a network of tunnels, caves, pillboxes, trenches, and camouflaged artillery locations. They also developed newer strategies to use their limited manpower to its fullest ability. The Japanese modified the landscape around the Island to allow for defensive lines meant to hold out as long as possible before falling back to another line[^14].

"A SERIES OF EVENTS..."

After some pre-invasion bombing that was largely unsuccessful due to the 32nd’s ability to hide from aerial reconnaissance[^15], the U.S. commenced operation “Iceberg” on April 1st, 1945. Following a successful occupation of Iwo Jima, the U.S. set their sights on Okinawa as their gateway to mainland Japan. Over 60,000 troops consisting of the U.S. Army’s 7th, 27th, and 96th ID along with the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions stormed the southwest coast of Okinawa[^16]. However, the landing troops met little resistance as most of the 130,000 Japanese soldiers of the 32nd had set up the tri-angular defensive position inland called the “Shuri Defense Line.”[^17]

Following the U.S. landing, the Japanese 32nd Army was ordered to hold off on attacks due to the risk of aerial interference, based on intelligence from April 4. During this pause, U.S. forces advanced inland, building the manpower and supplies needed for an assault on the Shuri line, while the 32nd awaited naval and aerial reinforcements. On April 6, Japan deployed a fleet with the battleship Yamato, the light cruiser Yahagi, and eight destroyers. However, on April 7, a U.S. reconnaissance plane spotted the fleet, leading to Task Force 58’s counterattack with 386 planes. In the ensuing raid, Japan lost the Yamato, Yahagi, and four destroyers, with another destroyer severely damaged and one burning. Task Force 58 lost only ten planes, cutting off critical support for the 32nd Army and leaving it isolated against U.S. forces[^18].
        	
Subsequently, the 32nd army decided it needed to go on the offensive to stop the advancing Americans. To achieve this, they organized a series of night raids to try and stop the push on April 12. However, changes in terrain due to constant artillery shelling left soldiers struggling to identify navigational landmarks. This coupled with the constant illumination of sporadic shell fire which forced the troops eyes to re-adjust to lighting constantly rendered the assault largely ineffective[^19].

{% assign media = site.media_metadata | where_exp: "item", "item.name == 'marineseaster'" %}
{% include media.html pages=media %}

With the failure of the night raids, the Japanese resorted to ultimate defensive combat. They hunkered down in the ridges and capitalized on their advantageous positioning to force the Americans into the close combat that they specialized in. There were over 600 men appointed for every 100 yards that the Americans took causing the advance to slow tremendously. And in just the section allotted to the American 77th ID (who replaced the 96th), there were over 25 pillboxes and hundreds of caves worth of infrastructure[^20] that allowed for the fluid and unpredictable movement of the 62nd ID.

These tactics allowed the Japanese to hold out for two months, but after successful assaults on the major defensive ridges by the Americans, and the collapse of the Shuri Defensive line, the 32nd was pushed to the southernmost tip of Okinawa and overwhelmed by late June. On June 22nd, 1945, with the Americans less than 100 feet away, the 32nd army generals committed seppuku, leaving their non-officer staff to organize their “final penetration” attack. 

In the following days, the remnants of the 24th ID continued to struggle against the Americans, but soon also lost their commanders to suicide, and ultimately surrendered. The surrender was not smooth, given that the Troops had been ordered not to, and that they believed they would be tortured and killed by the Americans. However by June 30th, the battle of Okinawa concluded[^21].

BEGINNING OF THE END?

The Battle of Okinawa is remembered as one of the bloodiest conflicts of the Pacific Theatre with around 76,000 casualties on the side of the Japanese, not including the raid on the naval fleet or Okinawan civilians which places the number well into the hundreds of thousands. The Americans faced around 66,000 losses to wounds, illness, and death[^22].

The results of Okinawa placed the Americans within striking distance of mainland Japan. However, it showed them that a direct assault on the island would result in insurmountable losses on both sides. These were brought into consideration by President Harry S. Truman on his decision to drop the Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima on August 6th[^23].
