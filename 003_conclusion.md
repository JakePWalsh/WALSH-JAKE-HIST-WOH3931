# Conclusion

While it has been debated since the cessation of hostilities whether World War II actually started in the Asia Pacific with Japan’s repeated campaigns against China, it is undisputed that Japan’s defeat, and that of its imperial ambitions, was formalized on the deck of the USS Missouri on September 2, 1945. 

As has been laid out, the moment was a culmination of years of conflict with the Allies, specifically the United States, as best evidenced by three pivotal battles: Japan’s initial invasion of the Philippines, the decisive naval encounter at Midway, and ferocious fighting on Okinawa. 

By following up their surprise attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 with a successful effort to drive the Americans off of the islands of the Philippines, Japan had gained the upper hand in the newly opened front. But it was as they sought to further deplete (and potentially knock out) their foe at Midway that Japan’s conquest was irrevocably reversed. In the Battle of Midway, Japan lost all four of its aircraft carriers and was left without the lethality necessary to continue its offensive objectives. General Douglas MacArthur’s subsequent “island-hopping” strategy and American victories on Iwo Jima and Okinawa gave the United States capability to carry out extensive and prolonged bombing on the Japanese mainland, most notably in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

And although Midway has been identified as the consensus turning point of the Japanese war effort among scholars, as this examination and analysis has shown, watershed moments do not happen in a vacuum. Just as Japan’s early victories and dominant political ideology of militarism and racial superiority imbued it with confidence in ultimate victory, so was the United States’ resource diversity and industrial base that made it a true sleeping giant. By entering into a war nearly impossible to win, Japan not only failed to achieve its overall aims, but had to experience significant destruction, a loss of national sovereignty, and the weight of history.
